# encoderb

- a sparesematrix kmer approach for the classification of the variant sequences.
- algorithmic support vector machine based classification of the variant for prediction of variant association. 
- why sparesekmer, as i can easily make a graph structure based on the loop and use the weight of the loop as 2 to add to the weighted kmer for the representation.
- adding a node to the edge that i am using the same in another crate for the graph attention neural network.
